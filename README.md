# Evaluation-Algorithm-of-Bachelors-Learning-Ability

The research project involved the construction and evaluation of different models to estimate the learning ability of undergraduate students. 
Key features were extracted from application materials of 1095 applicants for xxx University, and an evaluation model for learning ability was established using hierarchical analysis, entropy method, and factor analysis algorithms. 
Different deep learning modules, including a pre-trained BERT model for text processing and a fusion module for integrating feature information, were applied to measure students' learning ability.
Additionally, a multi-layer sensor network was utilized to predict the admission probability.
